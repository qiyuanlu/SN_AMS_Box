SN_AMS_Box is an Automated Material System (AMS) inspired by Bambulab AMS, MZ-AMS, and ERCF. The goal is to create a robust and stable open-source AMS system that can work with any Klipper printer.

Currently, it is still under development and will include features similar to the Bambulab AMS system. Four N20 motors are responsible for feeding the filament to the synchronized extruder, and at the same time, they also handle rewinding the filament back to the spool.

Features

	•	Multi-Material Management: Supports automatic switching and management of multiple materials.
	•	Compatibility: Designed to seamlessly integrate with any Klipper printer.
	•	Open Source: All designs and code are open-source, welcoming contributions and improvements.

Upcoming Features

	•	Validation and tuning of mechanical design
	•	Integration with MZ-AMS
	•	Integrated PCB design with STM32
	•	Elimination of USB connector requirement by using Canbus
	•	Integration with a dry box

To-Do List

	1.	Validate and tune mechanical design
	2.	Integrate MZ-AMS system
	3.	Design integrated PCB with STM32
	4.	Eliminate the need for a USB connector by moving to Canbus
	5.	Integrate with a dry box
